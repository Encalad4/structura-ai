# STRUCTURA-AI - Project Brief

## Problem statement
Any developer will tell you that documenting a file is their least favorite part of the developing process. Let alone the whole project. And yet, the lack of documentation also comes at a cost when new developers try and take over the managing of code. They would spend a big amount of time wondering through the documents and directories to try and understand the structure. 

## Solution
This extention means to take care of all the issues asociated with documentation. Much like the github copilot tool is able to go through the files in your project, and help you with suggestions, this tool can go through your files, understand it's structure, regardless of how convoluted it is, and will create one, or many .md files (the ammount of files generated can be selected by the user) that explain in detail the structure of the project, its dependencies and all of the relevant information about it. 

## Features
- Ask questions about your project structure (where is something, what folders contain certain things, etc...)
- Ask for documentation to be generated for the whole project, for a single file, API documentation and more
- Ask for code suggestion for more security, edge cases handling, generalization of queries and more
